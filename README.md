## AppTrack

AppTrack is the way for you to keep up with the jobs you have applied for.  In addition to keeping track, we let you give feedback about the interview experience- for example: was there whiteboarding? Or a code challenge? Was the interview easy or difficult?  We let you provide us with details on your experience to help others.

Once a user is signed up to use the service, they can review the history of other users job applications and interviews as well as input their own applications and interviews. Not only does this make keeping up with where you have applied easier, it also gives you access to information from others. It is a great way to manage your applications and interviews and keep track of whom to contact at the companies you have interviewed with.  

In choosing which technologies to use, we went with what we felt we understood the most and could leverage to build the best app.  We were able to utilize each other's strengths and work together to build a functional app that can help those in the software industry log their application path from start to hired.
